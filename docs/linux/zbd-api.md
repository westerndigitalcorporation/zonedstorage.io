# Zoned Block Device User Interface

User applications can use two types of interfaces to access the zone
information of zoned block devices and to manage the zones of zoned block
devices. These two types of interfaces are:

1. *sysfs* attribute files, which are accessible either directly from
   applications as regular files or from scripted languages (shell scripts,
   python, etc).

2. *ioctl()* system calls, which are suitable for use from C programs or other
   programming languages that have an equivalent system-call binding.

The *sysfs* files and *ioctl()* commands that are available to applications
have evolved since the introduction of zoned block device support in Kernel
4.10. The availability of files and commands per kernel version is detailed in
the following sections.

## Sysfs Interface

Programs that use scripting languages (e.g. bash scripts) can access zoned
device information through *sysfs* attribute files. These attribute files 
are shown in the following table.

<center>

| File | Kernel version | Description |
| :--- | :------------- | :---------- |
| /sys/block/*dev name*/queue/zoned | 4.10.0 | Device zoned model |
| /sys/block/*dev name*/queue/chunk_sectors | 4.10.0 | Device zone size |
| /sys/block/*dev name*/queue/nr_zones | 4.20.0 | Total number of zones |
| /sys/block/*dev name*/queue/zone_append_max_bytes | 5.8.0 | Maximum size in bytes of a zone append write operation |
| /sys/block/*dev name*/queue/max_open_zones | 5.9.0 | Maximum number of open zones |
| /sys/block/*dev name*/queue/max_active_zones | 5.9.0 | Maximum number of active zones |

</center>

### Device Zoned Model

The zone model of a zoned device can be discovered by using the `zoned` device
queue attribute file. For example: for a zoned block device named *sdb*, the
following shell command displays the device zoned model.

```plaintext
# cat /sys/block/sdb/queue/zoned
host-managed
```

The possible values of the *zoned* attribute file are shown in the table below.

<center>

| Value | Description |
| :---- | :---------- |
| none | Regular block device, including drive-managed SMR disks |
| host-aware | Host-aware device model |
| host-managed | Host-managed device model |

</center>

### Zone Size

The device zone size can be read from the *sysfs* queue attribute file that is
named `chunk_sectors`. For a device named *sdb* (the same device as in the
previous example), the following command gives the device zone size.

```plaintext
# cat /sys/block/sdb/queue/chunk_sectors
524288
```

The value is displayed as a number of 512B sectors, regardless of the actual
logical and physical block size of the device. In this example, the device zone
size is *524288 x 512 = 256 MiB*.

### Number of Zones

The sysfs queue attribute file *nr_zones* was introduced in Linux kernel version
4.20.0, and is available to obtain the total number of zones of a zoned device.

```plaintext
# cat /sys/block/sdb/queue/nr_zones
55880
```

This attribute value is always 0 for a regular block device.

### Zone Resources

The device zone resources can be read from the *sysfs* queue attribute files
that are named `max_open_zones` and `max_active_zones`.

For an SAS or SATA host-managed SMR disk named *sdb* (the same device as in the
previous example), the following command gives the maximum number of zones that
can be in the implicit or explicit open state.

```plaintext
# cat /sys/block/sdb/queue/max_open_zones
128
```

The value is displayed as a number of zones, with 0 indicating that the device
does not have any limit on the maximum number of zones that can be open.

For the same device, the following command gives the maximum number of zones
that can be active (open or closed state).

```plaintext
# cat /sys/block/sdb/queue/max_active_zones
0
```

The value is displayed as a number of zones, with 0 indicating that the device
does not have any limit on the maximum number of active zones. For SMR
hard-disks, this limit is always 0.

The values that are advertised by these attributes vary, depending on the
device. The following shows an example with an NVMe ZNS device.

```plaintext
# cat /sys/block/nvme0n1/queue/max_open_zones
14
# cat /sys/block/nvme0n1/queue/max_active_zones
14
```

When emulating a zoned device using [*null_blk*](../getting-started/nullblk.md),
[*QEMU*](../getting-started/zns-emulation.md) or
[*tcmu-runner*](../getting-started/smr-emulation.md), the values of these
attributes can be manually configured to emulate different physical device
characteristics.

## *ioctl()* Application Programming Interface

The C header file `/usr/include/linux/blkzoned.h` contains macro definitions and
data structure definitions that allow application developers to obtain
information about zoned block devices and to manage the zones of the devices.

### Zone Information Data Structures

The data structure `struct blk_zone` defines a zone-descriptor structure that 
contains a complete description of a zone: this includes the zone's location on
the device, the zone type, its condition (state), and the position of the zone
write pointer (for sequential zones). For kernels Up to kernel version 5.8, this
data structure is as shown below.

```c
/**
 * struct blk_zone - Zone descriptor for BLKREPORTZONE ioctl.
 *
 * @start: Zone start in 512 B sector units
 * @len: Zone length in 512 B sector units
 * @wp: Zone write pointer location in 512 B sector units
 * @type: see enum blk_zone_type for possible values
 * @cond: see enum blk_zone_cond for possible values
 * @non_seq: Flag indicating that the zone is using non-sequential resources
 *           (for host-aware zoned block devices only).
 * @reset: Flag indicating that a zone reset is recommended.
 * @reserved: Padding to 64 B to match the ZBC/ZAC defined zone descriptor size.
 *
 * start, len, capacity and wp use the regular 512 B sector unit, regardless
 * of the device logical block size. The overall structure size is 64 B to
 * match the size of the ZBC-, ZAC- and ZNS-defined zone descriptor and to 
 * allow support for future additional zone information.
 */
struct blk_zone {
        __u64   start;          /* Zone start sector */
        __u64   len;            /* Zone length in number of sectors */
        __u64   wp;             /* Zone write pointer position */
        __u8    type;           /* Zone type */
        __u8    cond;           /* Zone condition */
        __u8    non_seq;        /* Non-sequential write resources active */
        __u8    reset;          /* Reset write pointer recommended */
        __u8    reserved[36];
};
```

As indicated in the comments on this data structure definition, the unit that
is used to indicate (1) the zone start position, (2) the zone's size and (3) the
write pointer position is "512B sector size". This holds true regardless of the
actual logical block size of the device. Even for a device with a 4KB logical
sector, the above zone descriptor fields use a 512-byte sector size unit.

The *capacity* field was added to *struct blk_zone* in kernel version 5.9. In kernel versions 5.9 and later (which contain the *capacity* field), the data structure is as follows.

```
/**
 * struct blk_zone - Zone descriptor for BLKREPORTZONE ioctl.
 *
 * @start: Zone start in 512 B sector units
 * @len: Zone length in 512 B sector units
 * @wp: Zone write pointer location in 512 B sector units
 * @type: see enum blk_zone_type for possible values
 * @cond: see enum blk_zone_cond for possible values
 * @non_seq: Flag indicating that the zone is using non-sequential resources
 *           (for host-aware zoned block devices only).
 * @reset: Flag indicating that a zone reset is recommended.
 * @resv: Padding for 8B alignment.
 * @capacity: Zone usable capacity in 512 B sector units
 * @reserved: Padding to 64 B to match the ZBC, ZAC and ZNS defined zone
 *            descriptor size.
 *
 * start, len, capacity and wp use the regular 512 B sector unit, regardless
 * of the device logical block size. The overall structure size is 64 B to
 * match the ZBC, ZAC and ZNS defined zone descriptor and allow support for
 * future additional zone information.
 */
struct blk_zone {
        __u64   start;          /* Zone start sector */
        __u64   len;            /* Zone length in number of sectors */
        __u64   wp;             /* Zone write pointer position */
        __u8    type;           /* Zone type */
        __u8    cond;           /* Zone condition */
        __u8    non_seq;        /* Non-sequential write resources active */
        __u8    reset;          /* Reset write pointer recommended */
        __u8    resv[4];
        __u64   capacity;       /* Zone capacity in number of sectors */
        __u8    reserved[24];
};
```

The *capacity* field indicates the usable zone capacity of a zone in units of
512B sectors. The presence, or validity, of this field within the structure is
indicated using a zone report flag.
See [*Obtaining Zone Information*](#obtaining-zone-information) below for
details.

### Zone Type

The `type` field of a zone descriptor can have only one of the values defined by
the enumeration `enum blk_zone_type`.

```c
/**
 * enum blk_zone_type - Types of zones allowed in a zoned device.
 *
 * @BLK_ZONE_TYPE_CONVENTIONAL: The zone has no write pointer and can be writen
 *                              randomly. Zone reset has no effect on the zone.
 * @BLK_ZONE_TYPE_SEQWRITE_REQ: The zone must be written sequentially
 * @BLK_ZONE_TYPE_SEQWRITE_PREF: The zone can be written non-sequentially
 *
 * Any other value not defined is reserved and must be considered as invalid.
 */
enum blk_zone_type {
        BLK_ZONE_TYPE_CONVENTIONAL      = 0x1,
        BLK_ZONE_TYPE_SEQWRITE_REQ      = 0x2,
        BLK_ZONE_TYPE_SEQWRITE_PREF     = 0x3,
};
```

### Zone Condition

The `cond` field of the `struct blkzone` data structure defines the current
condition of a zone. The possible condition (state) values of this field are
defined by the `blk_zone_cond` enumeration.

```c
/**
 * enum blk_zone_cond - Condition [state] of a zone in a zoned device.
 *
 * @BLK_ZONE_COND_NOT_WP: The zone has no write pointer, it is conventional.
 * @BLK_ZONE_COND_EMPTY: The zone is empty.
 * @BLK_ZONE_COND_IMP_OPEN: The zone is open, but not explicitly opened.
 * @BLK_ZONE_COND_EXP_OPEN: The zones was explicitly opened by an
 *                          OPEN ZONE command.
 * @BLK_ZONE_COND_CLOSED: The zone was [explicitly] closed after writing.
 * @BLK_ZONE_COND_FULL: The zone is marked as full, possibly by a zone
 *                      FINISH ZONE command.
 * @BLK_ZONE_COND_READONLY: The zone is read-only.
 * @BLK_ZONE_COND_OFFLINE: The zone is offline (sectors cannot be read/written).
 *
 * The Zone Condition state machine in the ZBC/ZAC standards maps the above
 * deinitions as:
 *   - ZC1: Empty         | BLK_ZONE_EMPTY
 *   - ZC2: Implicit Open | BLK_ZONE_COND_IMP_OPEN
 *   - ZC3: Explicit Open | BLK_ZONE_COND_EXP_OPEN
 *   - ZC4: Closed        | BLK_ZONE_CLOSED
 *   - ZC5: Full          | BLK_ZONE_FULL
 *   - ZC6: Read Only     | BLK_ZONE_READONLY
 *   - ZC7: Offline       | BLK_ZONE_OFFLINE
 *
 * Conditions 0x5 to 0xC are reserved by the current ZBC/ZAC spec and should
 * be considered invalid.
 */
enum blk_zone_cond {
        BLK_ZONE_COND_NOT_WP    = 0x0,
        BLK_ZONE_COND_EMPTY     = 0x1,
        BLK_ZONE_COND_IMP_OPEN  = 0x2,
        BLK_ZONE_COND_EXP_OPEN  = 0x3,
        BLK_ZONE_COND_CLOSED    = 0x4,
        BLK_ZONE_COND_READONLY  = 0xD,
        BLK_ZONE_COND_FULL      = 0xE,
        BLK_ZONE_COND_OFFLINE   = 0xF,
};
```

Under a device's normal operation, some of these conditions cannot result
directly from host-initiated operations. These conditions are
`BLK_ZONE_COND_OFFLINE` and `BLK_ZONE_COND_READONLY`. They can be set only by
the device itself, and are set to indicate zones with capabilities that have
been limited by a hardware defect.

User operations (either write operations or zone management commands) can
result in transitions to other conditions. Applications that use the kernel
*ioctl()* interface can issue zone managment commands. See [*ioctl()*
Commands](#ioctl-commands) for more information about this.

The SCSI Zoned Block Command specification (ZBC), the ATA Zoned Device ATA
Command Set specification (ZAC) and the NVM Express Zoned Namespace Command
Set specification (ZNS) define a zone condition state machine that governs the
possible transitions of a zone from one condition to another depending on the
commands executed.

## *ioctl()* Commands

Several *ioctl()* commands are defined to manipulate and obtain information and
manipulate the zones of a zoned block device. All supported commands are shown
below.

```c
/**
 * Zoned block device ioctl's:
 *
 * @BLKREPORTZONE: Get zone information. Takes a zone report as argument.
 *                 The zone report will start from the zone containing the
 *                 sector specified in the report request structure.
 * @BLKRESETZONE: Reset the write pointer of the zones in the specified
 *                sector range. The sector range must be zone aligned.
 * @BLKGETZONESZ: Get the device zone size in number of 512 B sectors.
 * @BLKGETNRZONES: Get the total number of zones of the device.
 * @BLKOPENZONE: Open the zones in the specified sector range.
 *               The 512 B sector range must be zone aligned.
 * @BLKCLOSEZONE: Close the zones in the specified sector range.
 *                The 512 B sector range must be zone aligned.
 * @BLKFINISHZONE: Mark the zones as full in the specified sector range.
 *                 The 512 B sector range must be zone aligned.
 */
#define BLKREPORTZONE   _IOWR(0x12, 130, struct blk_zone_report)
#define BLKRESETZONE    _IOW(0x12, 131, struct blk_zone_range)
#define BLKGETZONESZ    _IOR(0x12, 132, __u32)
#define BLKGETNRZONES   _IOR(0x12, 133, __u32)
#define BLKOPENZONE     _IOW(0x12, 134, struct blk_zone_range)
#define BLKCLOSEZONE    _IOW(0x12, 135, struct blk_zone_range)
#define BLKFINISHZONE   _IOW(0x12, 136, struct blk_zone_range)
```

Not all commands are available on all kernel versions. The following table shows
which kernel version introduced each command.

<center>

| Command | Kernel version | Description |
| :------ | :------------- | :---------- |
| BLKREPORTZONE | 4.10.0 | Get zone information |
| BLKRESETZONE | 4.10.0 | Reset a zone write pointer |
| BLKGETZONESZ | 4.20.0 | Get a device zone size |
| BLKGETNRZONES | 4.20.0 | Get the total number of zones of a device |
| BLKOPENZONE | 5.5.0 | Explicitly open a zone |
| BLKCLOSEZONE | 5.5.0 | Close a zone |
| BLKFINISHZONE | 5.5.0 | Finish a zone |

</center>

### Obtaining Zone Information

The *BLKREPORTZONE* command allows an application to obtain a device's zone
information in the form of an array of zone descriptors. The data argument
that is passed to `ioctl()` must be the address of a memory area that is large
enough to store one `struct blk_zone_report` header structure, followed by an
array of zone descriptors.

The zone report header structure `blk_zone_report` is as shown below.

```c
/**
 * struct blk_zone_report - BLKREPORTZONE ioctl request/reply
 *
 * @sector: starting sector of report
 * @nr_zones: IN maximum / OUT actual
 * @reserved: padding to 16 byte alignment
 * @zones: Space to hold @nr_zones @zones entries on reply.
 *
 * The array of at most @nr_zones must follow this structure in memory.
 */
struct blk_zone_report {
	__u64		sector;
	__u32		nr_zones;
	__u8		reserved[4];
	struct blk_zone zones[0];
};
```

The header indicates the 512-byte sector from which the report should start as
well as the number of zone descriptors in the array following the header. A
typical use of the `BLKREPORTZONE` command to obtain information on all the
zones of a device is as shown below.

```c
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <linux/blkzoned.h>

unsigned long long start_sector = 0;
struct blk_zone_report *hdr;
size_t hdr_len;
int nr_zones = 256;

hdr_len = sizeof(struct blk_zone_report) + nr_zones * sizeof(struct blkzone);
hdr = malloc(hdr_len);
if (!hdr)
	return -1;

while (1) {
	hdr->sector = start_sector;
	hdr->nr_zones = nr_zones;

	ret = ioctl(fd, BLKREPORTZONE, hdr);
	if (ret)
		goto error;

	if (!hdr->nr_zones) {
		/* Done */
		break;
	}

	printf("Got %u zone descriptors\n", hdr->nr_zones);
	...

	/* The next report must start after the last zone reported */
	start_sector = hdr->zones[hdr->nr_zones - 1].start +
		       hdr->zones[hdr->nr_zones - 1].len;
}
```

The number of zone descriptors obtained is returned to the user in the
`nr_zones` field of the report header structure `blk_zone_report`.

When zone capacity support for NVMe Zoned Namepsaces was introduced in kernel
version 5.9, zone descriptors gained the `capacity` field. The presence of this
field is indicated by the new `flag` field added to `struct blk_zone_report`.

```c
/**
 * enum blk_zone_report_flags - Feature flags of reported zone descriptors.
 *
 * @BLK_ZONE_REP_CAPACITY: Zone descriptor has capacity field.
 */
enum blk_zone_report_flags {
        BLK_ZONE_REP_CAPACITY   = (1 << 0),
};

/**
 * struct blk_zone_report - BLKREPORTZONE ioctl request/reply
 *
 * @sector: starting sector of report
 * @nr_zones: IN maximum / OUT actual
 * @flags: one or more flags as defined by enum blk_zone_report_flags.
 * @zones: Space to hold @nr_zones @zones entries on reply.
 *
 * The array of at most @nr_zones must follow this structure in memory.
 */
struct blk_zone_report {
	__u64		sector;
	__u32		nr_zones;
	__u32		flags;
	struct blk_zone zones[0];
};
```

If the `flags` field of `struct blk_zone_report` has the flag
`BLK_ZONE_REP_CAPACITY` set, then the zone descriptor's structure will have a
valid value set in the `capacity` field of `sturct blk_zone`. Otherwise, this
field will show a value of 0 and can be ignored.

The example code below, extracted from the code of the
[*libzbd*](../tools/libzbd.md) library, illustrates how applications can
implement backward-compatible support for zone capacity information by using the
autotools build environment.

```
# less configure.ac
...
AC_CHECK_HEADER(linux/blkzoned.h, [],
                [AC_MSG_ERROR([Couldn't find linux/blkzoned.h. Kernel too old ?])],
                [[#include <linux/blkzoned.h>]])

AC_CHECK_MEMBER([struct blk_zone.capacity],
                [AC_DEFINE(HAVE_BLK_ZONE_REP_V2, [1], [report zones includes zone capacity])],
                [], [[#include <linux/blkzoned.h>]])
...

# less lib/zbd.h
...
/*
 * Handle kernel zone capacity support
 */
#ifndef HAVE_BLK_ZONE_REP_V2
#define BLK_ZONE_REP_CAPACITY   (1 << 0)

struct blk_zone_v2 {
        __u64   start;          /* Zone start sector */
        __u64   len;            /* Zone length in number of sectors */
        __u64   wp;             /* Zone write pointer position */
        __u8    type;           /* Zone type */
        __u8    cond;           /* Zone condition */
        __u8    non_seq;        /* Non-sequential write resources active */
        __u8    reset;          /* Reset write pointer recommended */
        __u8    resv[4];
        __u64   capacity;       /* Zone capacity in number of sectors */
        __u8    reserved[24];
};
#define blk_zone blk_zone_v2

struct blk_zone_report_v2 {
        __u64   sector;
        __u32   nr_zones;
        __u32   flags;
struct blk_zone zones[0];
};
#define blk_zone_report blk_zone_report_v2
#endif /* HAVE_BLK_ZONE_REP_V2 */
...
```

If this method is used, the main code that is responsible for issuing and
parsing zone reports always has access to the `capacity` field of `struct
blk_zone` regardless of the kernel version the code is executed on. For kernels
before kernel version 5.9, the zone capacity field is always equal to 0, which
means that the zone capacity should be ignored and that the zone size should be
used in its place. If your kernel lacks support for this field, you can still
use various coding techniques to return a zone capacity that is equal to the
zone size.

The command line utility [`blkzone`](../tools/util-linux.md#blkzone), which
is part of the *util-linux* project, uses the *BLKREPORTZONE* command to
implement its *report* function. Its code was modified similarly to the above
method to ensure its correct compilation and execution regardless of the version
of the kernel being used.

### Resetting a Zone Write Pointer

The write pointer of a single sequential zone or of a range of contiguous
sequential zones can be reset using the `BLKRESETZONE` command. Resetting a
sequential zone write pointer position will also transition the zone to the
*Empty* condition (`BLK_ZONE_COND_EMPTY`).

The range of zones targeted for resetting is defined using the data structure
`blk_zone_range`, shown below.

```c
/**
 * struct blk_zone_range - BLKRESETZONE/BLKOPENZONE/
 *                         BLKCLOSEZONE/BLKFINISHZONE ioctl
 *                         requests
 * @sector: Starting sector of the first zone to operate on.
 * @nr_sectors: Total number of sectors of all zones to operate on.
 */
struct blk_zone_range {
        __u64           sector;
        __u64           nr_sectors;
};
```

The `sector` field specifies the start sector of the first zone to reset. The
`nr_sectors` field specifies the total length of the range of zones to reset.
This length must be at least as large as one zone.

As indicated in comments describing the `blk_zone_range` structure, the commands
`BLKOPENZONE`, `BLKCLOSEZONE` and `BLKFINISHZONE` also use this data structure
to define the range of zones on which the command operates.

The following code shows an example use of the `BLKRESETZONE` command to reset
a single zone that starts at sector 274726912 and has a zone size of 256 MiB
(524288 sectors of 512B).

```c
#include <linux/blkzoned.h>

struct blk_zone_range zrange;
int ret;

zrange.sector = 274726912;
zrange.nr_sectors = 524288;

ret = ioctl(fd, BLKRESETZONE, &zrange);
if (ret)
	goto error;
...
```

The device file descriptor `fd` must be open for writing in order for this
command to succeed.

The  command line utility [`blkzone`](../tools/util-linux.md#blkzone) uses
the *BLKRESETZONE* command to implement its *reset* functionality.

### Opening, Closing and Finishing Zones

Explicitly opening a zone or a range of zones can be done using the
*BLKOPENZONE* command. This command uses the same arguments as the
*BLKRESETZONE* command. It takes a pointer to a data structure `blk_zone_range`,
which specifies the range of zones to operate on.

Closing a zone is done using the command *BLKCLOSEZONE*. Finishing a zone--that
is, transitioning the zone to the *full* condition (`BLK_ZONE_COND_FULL`), is
done using the *BLKFINISHZONE* command. Both of these commands also take as 
arguments a pointer to the `blk_zone_range` data structure to specify the range
of zones to operate on.

The *BLKOPENZONE*, *BLKCLOSEZONE* and *BLKFINISHZONE* commands were introduced
in kernel version 5.5.0.

### Zone Size and Number of Zones

Linux&reg; kernel version 4.20 introduced two new commands: one to obtain a
zoned device's zone size (`BLKGETZONESZ`), and one to obtain the total number
of zones of the device (`BLKGETNRZONES`). Both commands take a pointer to an
unsigned 32-bit integer variable as an argument, and both commands return the
zone-size value or the number of zones. The following sample C code illustrates
the use of these commands.

```c
#include <linux/blkzoned.h>
#include <stdio.h>

unsigned int nr_zones, zone_size;
int ret;

ret = ioctl(fd, ,BLKGETZONESZ, &zone_size);
if (ret)
	goto error;
ret = ioctl(fd, ,BLKGETNRZONES, &nr_zones);
