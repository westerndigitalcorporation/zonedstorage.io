# Getting Started with SMR Disks

Hard disk drives using the [Shingled Magnetic Recording](../introduction/smr.md)
technology can have different interface implementations resulting in different
usage models.

* **Drive Managed Interface** SMR disks implementing this interface are, from
  the host kernel and applications point of view, identical to regular disks and
  do not need any particular attention. Most Linux&reg; kernels will be able to
  handle these disks and no LBA space zoning information will be available to
  the host.  Drive Managed disks should thus not be considered as zoned block
  devices.

* **Zoned Block Interface** SMR hard-disk drives implementing the ZBC and ZAC
  feature sets provide to the host commands allowing the indentification and
  control of the device zones. This interface has two different variations, or
  model implementations (See [SMR Interface Implementations](../introduction/smr.md#smr-implementations)).

	* **Host Aware** While this zone model offers the convenience and
	  flexibility of Drive Managed disks (i.e. random write capabilities),
	  Host Aware disks support the full set of zone commands defined by the
	  ZBC and ZAC standards. As such, Host Aware disks can support both the
	  regular block device abstraction (regular disk) as well as the zoned
	  block device abstraction.

	* **Host Managed** This zone model defines a device type that is
	  different from regular disk. Host-Managed disks can only be used as
	  zoned block devices in order to satisfy the strong sequential write
	  constraints the model defines.

In the following sections, Host Aware disk models are considered as zoned block
devices with similar characteristics as Host Managed drives, that is, sequential
writes are assumed to be a constraint for the correct operation of the disk.

## Serial ATA ZAC Disks and SATA Host Controllers

Serial ATA (SATA) host adapters, including those using the Advance Host
Controller Interface (AHCI) standard, should have no problem scanning and
initializing a connection with Host Aware disks. Most AHCI host adapters are
also know to work with Host Managed disk drives as the adapter itself generally
does not react to the device signature of the connected disk.

### Verifying The Disk

For a system fullfilling all [prerequisites](prerequisite.md), a SATA host
Aware or Host Managed disk can simply be connected directly to a SATA port of
the host controller. After booting the system, the disk should be listed by the
*lsscsi* utility.

```plaintext
# lsscsi -g
[2:0:0:0]    disk    ATA      INTEL SSDSC2CT18 335u  /dev/sda   /dev/sg0
[5:0:0:0]    zbc     ATA      HGST HSH721415AL T220  /dev/sdb   /dev/sg1
```

In this example, the disk '/dev/sda' is the system boot disk and the disk
'/dev/sdb' is being recognized as a ZBC disk.

The second column of `lsscsi` output indicates the device type. The value *zbc*
is always used for Host Managed ZBC and ZAC disks. This corresponds to the ZBC
defined device type *0x14* for SAS disks and to the ZAC defined device signature
*0xabcd* for SATA disks. Since Host Aware disks have the same device type or
device signature as regular disks, lsscsi will list host aware disks as *disk*.

!!!note
    The *lsscsi* utility will not list a SATA ZAC disk with the type *zac*. The
    type *zbc* is always used as the kernel internally implements a SCSI to ATA
    translation layer (SAT), a;;owing ther representation of all SATA devices as
    SCSI devices.

### Checking The Disk Information

The zone model of the disk can be verified through the *zoned* sysfs attribute.

```plaintext
# cat /sys/block/sdb/queue/zoned
host-managed
```

The possible values of the *zoned* attribute are shown in the table below.

<center>

| Value | Description |
| ----- | ----------- |
| none | Regular disk or drive managed ZBC/ZAC disk |
| host-aware | Host aware ZBC/ZAC disk |
| host-managed | Host managed ZBC/ZAC disk |

</center>

The kernel messages also include useful information on the disk.

```plaintext
# dmesg

...
```

Among other information, the zone model of the disk is confirmed as
host managed. The total number of zones of the disk is also displayed. In this
example, the disk capacity is 15 TB and has 55880 zones.

The zone size of the disk can also be inspected through sysfs, with the
attribute *chunk_sectors*.

```plaintext
# cat /sys/block/sdb/queue/chunk_sectors 
524288
```

The value is displayed as a number of 512B sectors, regardless of the actual
logical and physical block size of the disk. In this example, the disk zone size
is *524288 x 512 = 256 MiB*.

Starting with Linux kernel version 4.20.0, the sysfs attribute *nr_zones*
is also available to verify the total number of zones of the disk.

```plaintext
# cat /sys/block/sdb/queue/nr_zones
55880
```

### Discovering The Disk Zone Configuration

To obtain detailed information on the disk zone configuration, for instance the
number of conventional zones available, the
[*blkzone*](/projects/util-linux#blkzone) utility can be used.

```plaintext
# blkzone report /dev/sdb
  start: 0x000000000, len 0x080000, wptr 0x000000 reset:0 non-seq:0, zcond: 0(nw) [type: 1(CONVENTIONAL)]
  start: 0x000080000, len 0x080000, wptr 0x000000 reset:0 non-seq:0, zcond: 0(nw) [type: 1(CONVENTIONAL)]
  start: 0x000100000, len 0x080000, wptr 0x000000 reset:0 non-seq:0, zcond: 0(nw) [type: 1(CONVENTIONAL)]
  ...
  start: 0x010480000, len 0x080000, wptr 0x000000 reset:0 non-seq:0, zcond: 0(nw) [type: 1(CONVENTIONAL)]
  start: 0x010500000, len 0x080000, wptr 0x000000 reset:0 non-seq:0, zcond: 0(nw) [type: 1(CONVENTIONAL)]
  start: 0x010580000, len 0x080000, wptr 0x000000 reset:0 non-seq:0, zcond: 0(nw) [type: 1(CONVENTIONAL)]
  start: 0x010600000, len 0x080000, wptr 0x000008 reset:0 non-seq:0, zcond: 4(cl) [type: 2(SEQ_WRITE_REQUIRED)]
  start: 0x010680000, len 0x080000, wptr 0x000000 reset:0 non-seq:0, zcond: 1(em) [type: 2(SEQ_WRITE_REQUIRED)]
  start: 0x010700000, len 0x080000, wptr 0x000000 reset:0 non-seq:0, zcond: 1(em) [type: 2(SEQ_WRITE_REQUIRED)]
  ...
  start: 0x6d2280000, len 0x080000, wptr 0x000000 reset:0 non-seq:0, zcond: 1(em) [type: 2(SEQ_WRITE_REQUIRED)]
  start: 0x6d2300000, len 0x080000, wptr 0x000000 reset:0 non-seq:0, zcond: 1(em) [type: 2(SEQ_WRITE_REQUIRED)]
  start: 0x6d2380000, len 0x080000, wptr 0x000000 reset:0 non-seq:0, zcond: 1(em) [type: 2(SEQ_WRITE_REQUIRED)]
```

From the output, one can see that the 512B sector range from 0 up to
0x010600000 is divided into 524 conventional zones. The sector space starting
from 0x010600000 until the last sector of the disk is devided into 55356
sequential write required zones.

The [*zbc_report_zones*](/projects/libzbc#zone-information) of
[*libzbc*](/projects/libzbc) provides more detailed information in a more
readable format.

```

## Using a SAS Host Bus Adapter

AHCI adapters can only accomodate Serial ATA disks and generally only provide a
limited number of ports. SAS Host Bus Adapters (HBA) are widely used in
enterprise applications to overcome AHCI limitations. The SAS transport layer
used by SAS HBAs can equally accomodate both Serial ATA and SCSI disks.

### HBA Compatibility

While most AHCI adapters for Serial ATA disks generally do not cause any
problem with host managed ZAC disks identification, SAS HBAs on the other
hand may suffer from a lack of support depending on the HBA model being used.

The compatibility of a SAS HBA with host managed disks mainly depends on
the following factors.

1. The HBA must have the ability to recognize the host managed device type
   *0x14* of host managed SAS disks (ZBC/SCSI).

2. The HBA must have the ability to recognize the host managed device signature 
   *0xabcd* of SATA host managed ZAC disks and translate this signature into
   the ZBC defined SCSI device type *0x14*.

3. Generalizing the previous point, the HBA must implement a SCSI-to-ATA
   translation (SAT) layer supporting the conversion of host issued ZBC zone
   commands into ZAC zone commands that can be executed by a SATA ZAC disk
   connected to the HBA.

Any HBA failing the first requirement will not expose a ZBC host managed disk to
the host. Similarly, an HBA failing to comply with the second and third
requirement will fail to expose to the host a host managed ZAC disk as a ZBC
host managed disk.

In the case of a host aware disk model, the device type and device signature
handling will not cause any problem (recall that host aware disks use the
regular disk device type and signatur *0x00*). Host aware disks will thus always
be useable as regular disks with any HBA. The execution of ZBC zone commands
with a SAS host aware disk may also work most of the time. However, similarly
to host managed disk, the absence of a ZBC/ZAC compatible SAT layer will prevent
the use of a Serial ATA host aware disk as a ZBC host aware disk. The ZBC zone
commands sent to the SATA disk will not be translated and result in command
failures.

The compatibility of an HBA model with the ZBC and ZAC standards should be
checked with the HBA vendor. Under some conditions, an HBA compatibility can
also be checked using the [*libzbc* conformance test suite](/tests/zbc-tests).

### Verifying The Disk

If you are using a compatible HBA and you have connected the drive and rebooted
the system, verifying the disk identification and checking the disk parameters
and zone configuration can be done in the exact same manner as with Serial ATA
disks as discussed above.

!!! Note

    Remember that most SAS HBAs have plug-and-play features that make 
    it unnecessary to reboot the system after connecting or disconnecting 
    a disk to it.


In these examples, `/dev/sdc` is an SAS disk connected to an SAS HBA and
*/dev/sdd* is a SATA disk connected to the same HBA.

```plaintext
# lsscsi -g

[10:0:3:0]   zbc     ATA      HGST HSH721415AL T220  /dev/sdd   /dev/sg3
```   

Inspecting the kernel messages shows no differences between the initialization
of the SAS drive and the SATA disk.

Both disks are identified by the kernel as *Direct-Access-ZBC* devices.  This
indicates that the HBA is correctly translating the ZAC host managed device
signature into a ZBC host managed device type.
