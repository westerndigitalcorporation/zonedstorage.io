# SCSI Generic Utilities

Various open source projects provide tools that support the direct manipulation
of SCSI devices. The *lsscsi* command line tool and the *sg3_utils* library and
utilities collection are among the tools most widely used for SCSI device
manipulation. They are available as pre-compiled packages with most Linux&reg;
distributions.

*lsscsi* has the capability to indicate if a device is a ZBC host managed zoned
block device. *sg3_utils* added support for ZBC in version 1.42.

## lsscsi

The <a href="http://sg.danny.cz/scsi/lsscsi.html" target="_blank">*lsscsi*</a>
command lists information about the SCSI devices that are connected to a Linux
system. *lsscsi* is available as a package in most Linux distributions. For
example, in [Fedora&reg;](../distributions/linux.md#fedora-linux) Linux,
*lssci* can be installed using the following command:

```plaintext
# dnf install lsscsi
```
The name of the package may differ from distribution to distribution. Refer to
the documentation of the given distribution to discover the name of the package
that provides *lssci*.

### Identifying Host Managed Disks

*lsscsi* lists the disks that are managed using the kernel SCSI subsystem. This
always includes SATA disks that are directly connected (1) to a SATA port on
the system mainboard or (2) to a SATA PCIe adapter.

```plaintext
# lsscsi
[2:0:0:0]    disk    ATA      INTEL SSDSC2CT18 335u  /dev/sda
[4:0:0:0]    zbc     ATA      HGST HSH721414AL T220  /dev/sdb
[10:0:1:0]   zbc     HGST     HSH721414AL52M0  a220  /dev/sdc
[10:0:3:0]   zbc     ATA      HGST HSH721415AL T220  /dev/sdd
```

The second column of the default output indicates the device type. For host
managed disks, the type name is `zbc`. For regular disks, the type name is
`disk`. Older versions of *lsscsi* may directly list the numerical value of the
device type. In the case of host managed disks, `0x14` is displayed.

Adding the option `-g` to the *lssci* command returns the SCSI Generic node
file path associated with a device. This can be useful in combination with 
[libzbc](libzbc.md) or any of the *sg3_utils* command line tools.

```plaintext
# lsscsi -g
[2:0:0:0]    disk    ATA      INTEL SSDSC2CT18 335u  /dev/sda   /dev/sg0
[4:0:0:0]    zbc     ATA      HGST HSH721414AL T220  /dev/sdb   /dev/sg1
[10:0:1:0]   zbc     HGST     HSH721414AL52M0  a220  /dev/sdc   /dev/sg2
[10:0:3:0]   zbc     ATA      HGST HSH721415AL T220  /dev/sdd   /dev/sg3

```

### Disks Interface and Transport

The third column of the output is the disk vendor ID. For ATA disks, this is
always `ATA` even for ATA disks connected to a SAS host-bus-adapter (HBA). The
*transport* that is used to communicate with the disk can be more precisely
discovered using the `-t` option.

```plaintext
# lsscsi -t
[2:0:0:0]    disk    sata:55cd2e4000111f9b           /dev/sda
[4:0:0:0]    zbc     sata:5000cca25bc03731           /dev/sdb
[10:0:1:0]   zbc     sas:0x5000cca0000025c5          /dev/sdc
[10:0:3:0]   zbc     sas:0x300062b200f35d43          /dev/sdd
```

## sg3_utils

The <a href="http://sg.danny.cz/sg/sg3_utils.html"
target="_blank">*sg3_utils*</a> project provides a library and a collection of
command line tools that directly send SCSI commands to SCSI devices using the
kernel SCSI generic driver.

The SCSI generic driver (*sg* driver) is enabled by default on most
distributions. Use the following command to check whether the *sg* driver
module is loaded:

```plaintext
# cat /proc/modules | grep sg
```

If the output of this command is empty, the *sg* driver is loaded:

```plaintext
# modprobe sg
```
These commands work only if the *sg* driver was compiled as a loadable kernel
module. If you experience errors (as shown below), use the command (the `cat`
command after the error message) to verify that the *sg* driver was compiled as
part of the kernel: 

```plaintext
# modprobe sg
modinfo: ERROR: Module sg not found.

# cat /lib/modules/`uname -r`/modules.builtin | grep sg
kernel/drivers/scsi/sg.ko
```
Because all disks in Linux are exposed as SCSI devices (including all ATA
drives), these utilities can be used to manage both (1) SCSI ZBC disks and (2)
SATA ZAC disks. For cases in which SATA disks are connected to SATA ports (e.g.
an AHCI adapter), the kernel SCSI subsystem translates SCSI commands to ATA
commands.

*sg3_utils* includes three command line tools that are specific to ZBC disks:

<center>

| Utility Name | Main SCSI Command Invoked | Description |
| :----------: | :------------------------ | :---------- |
| **sg_rep_zones** | REPORT ZONES | Get a ZBC disk zone information |
| **sg_reset_wp** | RESET WRITE POINTER | Reset one or all zones of a ZBC disk |
| **sg_zone** | CLOSE ZONE, FINISH ZONE, OPEN ZONE | Sends one of these commands to the given ZBC device |

</center>

:::caution
The help output of the commands below uses the term "LBA". In this context,
"LBA" refers to a 512-byte sector size regardless of the logical and physical
block size of the disk.
:::

### sg_rep_zone

Running the command `sg_rep_zone` with the `--help` option returns a simple
usage explanation.

```plaintext
# sg_rep_zones --help
Usage: sg_rep_zones  [--help] [--hex] [--maxlen=LEN] [--partial]
                     [--raw] [--readonly] [--report=OPT] [--start=LBA]
                     [--verbose] [--version] DEVICE
  where:
    --help|-h          print out usage message
    --hex|-H           output response in hexadecimal; used twice
                       shows decoded values in hex
    --maxlen=LEN|-m LEN    max response length (allocation length in cdb)
                           (def: 0 -> 8192 bytes)
    --partial|-p       sets PARTIAL bit in cdb
    --raw|-r           output response in binary
    --readonly|-R      open DEVICE read-only (def: read-write)
    --report=OPT|-o OP    reporting options (def: 0: all zones)
    --start=LBA|-s LBA    report zones from the LBA (def: 0)
                          need not be a zone starting LBA
    --verbose|-v       increase verbosity
    --version|-V       print version string and exit

Performs a SCSI REPORT ZONES command.
```

Below is an example of the `sg_rep_zone` utility output:

```plaintext
# sg_rep_zone /dev/sdd
Report zones response:
  Same=1: zone type and length same in each descriptor

  Maximum LBA: 0xda47ffff
 Zone descriptor: 0
   Zone type: Conventional
   Zone condition: Not write pointer
   Non_seq: 0
   Reset: 0
   Zone Length: 0x10000
   Zone start LBA: 0x0
   Write pointer LBA: 0xffffffffffff
 Zone descriptor: 1
   Zone type: Conventional
   Zone condition: Not write pointer
   Non_seq: 0
   Reset: 0
   Zone Length: 0x10000
   Zone start LBA: 0x10000
   Write pointer LBA: 0xffffffffffff
 Zone descriptor: 2
   Zone type: Conventional
   Zone condition: Not write pointer
   Non_seq: 0
   Reset: 0
   Zone Length: 0x10000
   Zone start LBA: 0x20000
   Write pointer LBA: 0xffffffffffff
 ...
```

:::note
Either (1) the block device file path or (2) the device SCSI Generic node file
path can be used to specify a disk.
:::

It is possible to start a zone report at a specific zone by using the
`--start` option. For example, to obtain the zone information starting at the
first sequential zone of the disk (LBA 34340864), use the following command:

```plaintext
# sg_rep_zones --start=34340864 /dev/sdd
Report zones response:
  Same=1: zone type and length same in each descriptor

  Maximum LBA: 0xda47ffff
 Zone descriptor: 0
   Zone type: Sequential write required
   Zone condition: Empty
   Non_seq: 0
   Reset: 0
   Zone Length: 0x10000
   Zone start LBA: 0x20c0000
   Write pointer LBA: 0x20c0000
 Zone descriptor: 1
   Zone type: Sequential write required
   Zone condition: Empty
   Non_seq: 0
   Reset: 0
   Zone Length: 0x10000
   Zone start LBA: 0x20d0000
   Write pointer LBA: 0x20d0000
 ...
```

### sg_reset_wp

Running the command `sg_reset_wp` with the `--help` option returns a simple
usage explanation:

```plaintext
# sg_reset_wp --help
Usage: sg_reset_wp  [--all] [--help] [--verbose] [--version]
                    [--zone=ID] DEVICE
  where:
    --all|-a           sets the ALL flag in the cdb
    --help|-h          print out usage message
    --verbose|-v       increase verbosity
    --version|-V       print version string and exit

    --zone=ID|-z ID    ID is the starting LBA of the zone whose
                       write pointer is to be reset
Performs a SCSI RESET WRITE POINTER command. ID is decimal by default,
for hex use a leading '0x' or a trailing 'h'. Either the --zone=ID
or --all option needs to be given.
```

Reset all sequential write zones on the disk by using the `--all` option:

```plaintext
# sg_reset_wp --all /dev/sdd
```

Reset a single sequential zone write pointer by using the `--zone` option:

```plaintext
# sg_reset_wp --zone=34340864 /dev/sdd
```

Specifying the zone ID (zone start LBA) of a conventional zone results in
an error:

```plaintext
# sg_reset_wp --zone=0 /dev/sdd
Reset write pointer command: Illegal request
```

Reseting the write pointer of an empty sequential write zone has no effect
and does not result in an error.

### sg_zone

Running the command `sg_zone` with the `--help` option returns a simple usage
explanation:

```plaintext
# sg_zone --help
Usage: sg_zone  [--all] [--close] [--finish] [--help] [--open]
                [--verbose] [--version] [--zone=ID] DEVICE
  where:
    --all|-a           sets the ALL flag in the cdb
    --close|-c         issue CLOSE ZONE command
    --finish|-f        issue FINISH ZONE command
    --help|-h          print out usage message
    --open|-o          issue OPEN ZONE command
    --verbose|-v       increase verbosity
    --version|-V       print version string and exit
    --zone=ID|-z ID    ID is the starting LBA of the zone

*sg_zone* can perform OPEN ZONE, CLOSE ZONE or FINISH ZONE SCSI commands. ID is
decimal by default. To enter a hexadecimal value, use a leading '0x' or a
trailing 'h'. One of the following options must be provided: (1) `--close`, (2)
`--finish`, or (3) `--open`.

There is no `--reset` option. Such an option would duplicate the function of
the *sg_reset_wp* utility.
```

The following example shows a sequence of commands that illustrate the effects
that the *sg_zone* and *sg_reset_wp* commands have on the condition of a zone,
as reported with *sg_rep_zone*. At the beginning of this sequence of commands,
the sequential zone on the disk is explicitly opened from an empty condition.
Then the zone is transitioned to a full condition by using the "zone finish"
command. Finally, the zone is again reset to an empty condition.

```plaintext
