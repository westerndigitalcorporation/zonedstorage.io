# tcmu-runner ZBC Disk Emulation

*tcmu-runner* is an application daemon that can handle the execution of SCSI
commands that are sent by the kernel SCSI target sub component. It makes it
possible for exported SCSI Logical Units (LUNs) to be backed by regular files
or block devices.

## Overview

LinuxIO (LIO&trade;) is the standard open-source SCSI target implementation in the
Linux&reg; kernel. LIO supports all prevalent storage fabrics, including Fibre
Channel, FCoE, iEEE 1394, iSCSI, NVMe-OF, iSER, SRP, etc.

The Target Core Module Userspace (TCMU) implements a fabric that creates a link
between the kernel SCSI target infrastructure and a userspace application.
The kernel-level module that is involved is called `target_core_user` and can
be viewed as a virtual HBA.

*tcmu-runner* implements the userspace-level side of SCSI processing and
handles the details of the TCMU interface (UIO, netlink, pthreads, and DBus).
*tcmu-runner* exports a simpler C-plugin API that allows *file handlers* to be
created to emulate various device types. This is shown in the figure below.

The *ZBC file handler* implements the emulation of a SCSI ZBC host-aware or
host-managed disk by using the TCMU C plugin API. This handler uses a regular
file as the backend storage for the emulated device.

This infrastructure setup ensures that any command that is issued by an
application or by a kernel component (e.g. a file system) is sent to the
*tcmu-runner* daemon through the TCMU kernel driver. The file handler processes
the command in user space by using regular POSIX system calls and a reply is
sent back upon completion of processing of the command. From the point of view
of the application or kernel component that uses the emulated disk, all
accesses appear as though they have been executed on actual hardware.

## Compilation and Installation

The *tcmu-runner* project is hosted on <a href="https://github.com/open-iscsi/tcmu-runner"
target="_blank">GitHub</a>.  The project <a href="https://github.com/open-iscsi/tcmu-runner/blob/master/README.md"
target="_blank">*README*</a> file provides detailed information on how to
compile, install and execute *tcmu-runner* daemon.

The *targetcli* utility, which is available as a package in most distributions,
controls devices that are emulated with *tcmu-runner*. For example, on
[Fedora&reg;](../distributions/linux.md#fedora-linux) Linux, *tcmu-runner* and
*targetcli* can be installed using the following commands:

```plaintext
# dnf install tcmu-runner
# dnf install targetcli
```

## Kernel Components

*tcmu-runner* relies on the "loopback virtual SAS adapter kernel module" to
expose the emulated device to the kernel SCSI stack as a regular disk. To
enable this kernel module, you must first enable support for the *Generic
Target Core Mod (TCM) and ConfigFS Infrastructure* from the top-level *Device
Drivers* menu.

<Image src="linux-config-tcm1.png"
title="Target Core Module support option with make menuconfig"/>

Only after this infrastructure is enabled can the configuration options
*CONFIG_TCM_USER2* and *CONFIG_LOOPBACK_TARGET* be enabled.

## ZBC File Handler

*tcmu-runner* ZBC file handler is compiled and installed by default. This
handler makes it possible to create emulated ZBC disks that use a regular file
as backing storage.

The ZBC file handler supports the emulation of both host-aware and host-managed
SCSI disks. All the characteristics of the emulated device can be configured.
The following table shows the available configuration parameters:

| Option | Description | Default value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| model-**_type_** | Device model type, _HA_ for host aware or _HM_ for host managed | _HM_
| lba-**_size (B)_** | LBA size in bytes (512 or 4096) | 512
| zsize-**_size (MiB)_** | Zone size in MiB | 256 MiB
| conv-**_num_** | Number of conventional zones at LBA 0 (can be 0) | Number of zones corresponding to 1% of the device capacity
| open-**_num_** | Optimal (for host aware) or maximum (for host managed) number of open zones | 128

These parameters are always grouped together into a configuration string with
the format `/[opt1[/opt2][...]@]path_to_backing_file`. For example, to specify
a host managed disk with 128MB zone size, 100 conventional zones and the file
`/var/local/zbc0.raw` as backing storage, use the following configuration string:

```plaintext
cfgstring=model-HM/zsize-128/conv-100@/var/local/zbc.raw
```

## Creating an Emulated disk

The following example shows the creation of a small 20 GB host-managed ZBC disk
with 10 conventional zones and a zone size of 256 MiB, with the file
`/var/local/zbc0.raw` used as backing storage. The emulated disk is emulated
locally using the loopback interface. This requires that *tcmu-runner* is 
running on the system.

With *tcmu-runner* running, the *targetcli* command is used to create the
emulated disk.

```

The `backstore create` command specifies the capacity of the emulated disk with
the argument `size=20G`. The backing file `/var/local/zbc0.raw` is created if
necessary and is resized to match the specified capacity.

When the backstore is linked to `lun0` of the loopback link, the emulated
device becomes visible to the kernel and its management initialized the same
way physical devices are initialized. This is reported in the kernel messages
log:

```plaintext

```

The disk can now be listed with tools such as *lsblk* and *lsscsi*:

```

## Using an Emulated disk

All ZBD-compliant tools and applications are able to access and control the
emulated disk in exactly the same manner as they would control a physical
device. For example, the [*libzbc* graphical interface
(gzbc)](libzbc.md#graphical-interface) can be used to display the emulated disk
zones.

## Scripts

The following script creates an emulated disk with a single command:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

if [ $# != 5 ]; then
        echo "Usage: $0 <disk name> <cap (GB)> HM|HA <zone size (MB)> <conv zones num>"
        exit 1;
fi

dname="$1"
cap="$2"
model="$3"
zs="$4"
cnum="$5"

naa="naa.50014059cfa9ba75"

# Setup emulated disk
cat << EOF | targetcli

cd /backstores/user:zbc
create name=${dname} size=${cap}G cfgstring=model-${model}/zsize-${zs}/conv-${cnum}@/var/local/${dname}.raw
cd /loopback
create ${naa}
cd ${naa}/luns
create /backstores/user:zbc/${dname} 0
cd /
exit

EOF

sleep 1
disk=`lsscsi | grep "TCMU ZBC device" | cut -d '/' -f3 | sed 's/ //g'`
echo "mq-deadline" > /sys/block/"${disk}"/queue/scheduler
```

Tearing down an emulated disk can also be automated with a single command line
as shown below.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

if [ $# != 1 ]; then
	echo "Usage: $0 <disk name (e.g. zbc0)"
	exit 1;
fi

dname="$1"

naa="naa.50014059cfa9ba75"

# Delete emulated disk
cat << EOF | targetcli

cd /loopback/${naa}/luns
delete 0
cd /loopback
delete ${naa}
cd /backstores/user:zbc
delete ${dname}
cd /
exit

EOF
```
