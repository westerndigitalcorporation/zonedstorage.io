# Kernel Block Layer Tests

*blktests* is a test suite for Linux kernel storage stack, that is, the
block I/O layer as well as underlying device specific layers (SCSI, NVMe, SRP,
etc). *blktests* is heavily inspired by the *xfstests* framework for testing
file systems.

Recent contributions to *blktests* added zoned block device tests support.

The *blktests* project is hosted on
[GitHub](https://github.com/linux-blktests/blktests).

## Overview

*blktests* organizes test cases into groups. The test groups currently available
are as shown in the table below.

<center>

| Group name | Description |
| :--------- | :---------- |
| **block** | Block layer generic tests |
| **loop** | Loopback device tests |
| **meta** | *blktests* self tests |
| **nbd** | Network block device driver tests |
| **nvme** | NVMe driver tests |
| **nvmeof-mp** | NVME-over-fabrics multipath tests |
| **scsi** | SCSI layer tests |
| **srp** | SCSI RDMA Protocol driver tests |
| **zbd** | Zoned block device tests |

</center>

The test groups supporting zoned block devices are *block* and *zbd*.
[*blkzone*](/docs/tools/util-linux#blkzone) and [*fio*](/docs/benchmarking/fio/overview)
version 3.9 or higher must be installed for executing these test groups.

## Configuration

Detailed generic information on how to configure and run *blktests* is
provided <a href="https://github.com/osandov/blktests/blob/master/Documentation/running-tests.md"
target="_blank">here</a>.

For executing tests against a physical zoned block device (e.g. a ZBC/ZAC disk),
the following `config` file should be prepared and copied to the *blktests*
installation directory. Tests can also be executed directly from the source
directory if the `config` file is copied in that location.

```bash
# Tests target device list
TEST_DEVS=(/dev/sdd)

# Enable zoned block device mode for the block group genertic tests 
RUN_ZONED_TESTS=1
```

With this configuration, all tests relevant to zoned block devices will be
executed. The execution duration can be several 10s of minutes depending on the
target device and host system. To Shorten execution, the options `TIMEOUT` and
`QUICK_RUN` can be added to the configuration.

```bash
# Tests target device list
TEST_DEVS=(/dev/sdd)

# Enable zoned block device mode for the block group genertic tests
RUN_ZONED_TESTS=1

# Speed up execution (weaker tests)
QUICK_RUN=1
TIMEOUT=30
```

Of note is that the block layer generic tests of the *block* group also include
test cases executed against a logical device (*null_blk* block device). These
tests are executed twice, once with the *null_blk* device configured as a
regular block device and a second time with the *null_blk* device configured as
a zoned block device. To reduce the test cases execution to only the physical
device specified in the configuration file, the `DEVICE_ONLY` option can be set.

```bash
# Tests target device list
TEST_DEVS=(/dev/sdd)

# Enable zoned block device mode for the block group genertic tests
RUN_ZONED_TESTS=1

# Speed up execution (weaker tests)
QUICK_RUN=1
TIMEOUT=30

# Exercise only the devices in TEST_DEVS
DEVICE_ONLY=1
```

## Execution

*blktests* execution is done using the `check` script present in the top level
directory. This script optionally takes as argument a list of test groups or
test cases to execute. Bu default, without any argument, all test groups will be
executed.

For zoned block device tests, executing the test cases of the *block* and *zbd*
test groups is sufficient.

As discussed in the [configuration](#configuration) section above, several
options can speedup the execution of *blktests*. Such quick runs are indeed
faster but at the cost of weaker testing compared to full runs.

### Full Run

The following command executes all test cases relevant to zoned block devices
with the device specified in the `config` configuration file as target. In this
example, no options are added.

The output of some tests is *[not run]*. This is not a failure. This only
indicates that the target device specified in the configuration file does not
support the feature being tested. For example, in the above run, test case
*block/003* is not executed against the specified host managed disk because the
disk does not support the *discard* command.

### Quick Run

*blkltests* execution can be accelerated using the `TIMEOUT`, `QUICK_RUN` and
`DEVICE_ONLY` configuration options.

```bash
# Tests target device list
TEST_DEVS=(/dev/sdd)

# Enable zoned block device mode for the block group genertic tests
RUN_ZONED_TESTS=1

# Speed up execution (weaker tests)
QUICK_RUN=1
TIMEOUT=30

# Exercise only the devices in TEST_DEVS
DEVICE_ONLY=1
```

Running only the *block* and *zbd* test groups with the above configuration
gives the following results.
